# Interview Challenge
### NOTE ALL DATA IS RANDOMLY GENERATED AND IS NOT FROM ANY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
This is a challenge for potential candidates. The file uploaded to this github repository is where you will start your investigation. It is access logs for a company website. We believe one of the users accessed another user's account and proceeded to download data. You must find who downloaded the data and what the data that it contained was.

## Requirements
A successful candidate will write a script(s) that will analyze this log file looking for the offending log. Once they have identified the offending activity they will use that data to further write a script(s) to access the data the malicious user downloaded. 

Once complete the candidate will commit to a github project their scripts and a synopsis of the downloaded data. They should **NOT** upload the downloaded data as it contains **simulated** sensitive data. 

After the candidate has completed and uploaded their scripts they will notify the hiring manager of their success and provide them with the GitHub information for the SMEs to review. 

Please direct any question through the hiring manager. 

## Additional Details
To access the API you will require a header containing the following:

```X-API-Key: 4c5162f0```

Nothing further should be needed for the API header.

For this project you can assume that all usernames, IP addresses, and user agents should be the same except in the case of the malicious user using another users credentials.
